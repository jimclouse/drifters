""" drifter lifespan
    This module will aim to query the db and produce statistics on mortaility of drifters
    basic procedure will be to gather the min and max date of each drifter, calculate its
    lifespan, and create a table with all lifespans.
    I will need to examine any anomolies, for some drifter numbers can be re-used. Any
    drifter surviving too long should be looked at further for gaps that would indicate
    re-use
